        <h3> Day Dreamer and Wonderlust :))</h3>
        <p class="font">“The cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return, the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse. ” “Once you embrace your value, talents and strengths, it neutralizes when others think less of you.” “They say there's no harm in daydreaming, but there is.”
